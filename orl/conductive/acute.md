## Question

A **35**-year-old patient presents with **sudden | abrupt** onset hearing
loss in the **right** ear, noticed **72** hours ago. Hearing in that ear was
**normal | unchanged | at baseline** before this **episode | onset | change**.
**The patient reports a history of seasonal allergies.**

Otoscopic examination shows **clear | unobstructed** external auditory
canals and the **right** tympanic membrane appears 
**mildly retracted | slightly retracted | mildly inwardly displaced | subtly retracted** 
but intact.

Tuning fork testing **demonstrates | shows**

A):  
- Weber test lateralizes to the **right** ear
- Rinne test is negative on the **right** ear

B) that sound is heard **louder | more prominently** in the **right** ear when
the fork is placed on the forehead, and air conduction is
**worse than** bone conduction in the **right** ear.

The patient denies **vertigo, dizziness, tinnitus, otalgia, or
focal neurologic symptoms**.
**The patient reports mild nasal congestion.**
Vital signs are **normal | within normal limits**.
**The patient appears calm during the examination.**

What is the **most appropriate | best** management at this time?
